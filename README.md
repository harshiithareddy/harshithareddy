# Hi, I'm Harshitha 

By title, I’m an **Associate Business Analyst (Consultant)**.  
By work, I sit at the intersection of **product, delivery, and operational problem-solving**.

Across every role, my pattern is consistent:
I turn **complex workflows, unclear requirements, and stakeholder inputs** into **clarity, structure, and execution**

## What I Actually Do (across all my roles)

### ** 1. Product Thinking **
At Infosys:
- Drive product initiatives across **Account Onboarding, Money Movement, and Credit Insight**.
- Conduct **user research, workflow mapping, gap analysis**, and understand advisors and customers, pain-points.
- Translate insights into **PRDs, user stories, feature specs**.
- Define **MVP scope**, set priorities using RICE/ICE, and support sprint planning to align technical capacity with business needs.
- **KYC/AML integrations**, to improve onboarding automation and reduce verification failures.
- **Risk Scorecards & Dashboards**, that turn unstructured data into usable insights for decision-making.

  ### **2. Project & Delivery Leadership**
  Running the "engine room" of execution:
  - Lead **Agile ceremonies** (scrums, grooming, retrospectives, sprint planning).
  - Maintain **Project Documentation**, roadmaps, scope changes, design decisions, progress updates.
  - Balance constraints from **Engineering, Operations, Compliance, and Stakeholders** to maintain realistic, aligned delivery.
